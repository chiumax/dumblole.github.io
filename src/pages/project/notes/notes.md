# Background

I love learning but I don't like school nor am I that good of a student. I barely take any notes during class; A simple 100-page notebook can last me for an entire year. I have 8 classes a day, 2 semesters a year, and from September to June. For one, there's little choice as to what to learn and most classes are boring. There's required classes and most of what's taught gets forgotten 1-2 weeks after an assessment. _What a huge waste of time!_ Spending week after week in class working towards an assessment just to boost your average.

Now that I'm going to college this year and I'm going to have a lot more time on my hands. There are many things I want to learn about. With advanced subjects there are going to be a lot of details to know about. I plan on using this site to compile all the notes for the classes I'll be taking from college and onward.

# Result

I built a simple site using [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/), a Vue-powered Static Site Generator. Visit it here: [Notes](https://dumblole.github.io/notes/). All courses are organized from newest to oldest and all chapters in sequential order.

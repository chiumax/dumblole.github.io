# Background

This year, 2019, FIRST Robotics Team 4099 (Poolesville High School) participated for the first time in the FIRST Robotics Competition 2019 Digital Animation Award sponsored by [Automation Direct](https://library.automationdirect.com/). Every year there is a different theme. This year's theme was 

>"Space" - you can interpret that however you want. 

The title of our submission was "The Simulation of Life". Link to competition [details](https://library.automationdirect.com/the-first-robotics-competition-2019-digital-animation-award-winner/).

# Result

The judging for the competition was by [Theory Studios](https://theorystudios.com/). FRC Team 4099's animation was **selected** as a "Judges Favorite" along with 11 other teams out of 101 team submissions. These 11 teams received some personalized feedback and as a first time animator, I felt lucky to get some feedback from employed animators/artists.


>This caused a lot of internal debates over story, which is a good thing! Having your audience watch over and over and ask questions is good. Very enjoyable style and movement, great use of camera rack. Overall would recommend studying more motion design, could be a great future there!

# Process

My friend [Dineth Meegoda](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5CWv0Ooupy-6EyoSJiA2Yw) and I worked together to make this 30 second animation around 20 days before the submission was supposed to be due. This should've been enough time but when your school days are 12 hours long and you have other stuff to do while it's all bundled up with the **procrastinative** tendencies of two highschoolers, you can probably guess how bad it got as time neared the deadline.

Dineth and I brainstormed ideas for the first couple days and discussed them with the rest of the business team and although slightly **skeptical**, we chose an idea I thought of so I started work with the story.

Dineth was responsible for the **art** of the animation ([Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html)) and started drawing possible props for the animation. Much inspiration of the style was from [Kurzgesagt](https://www.youtube.com/user/Kurzgesagt), a youtube channel that explores science with beautiful animations.

Time was short so I started **animation** ([Adobe After Effects](https://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects.html)) while Dineth was illustrating. Some things got kinda **frustrating** because of the amount of layers I had in my composition that caused my computer to be slow. Another thing was trying to animate what the illustrator gave me and if I couldn't I had to ask and wait for something like more joints on a character.

As time was nearing the end, productivity had to go up in order to meet the deadline. There were a couple sleepless nights and a flunked math quiz along with several empty monster and redbull cans before the animation was submitted.

# Closing

While discussing the idea with the team, they were skeptical of the **feasability** of the idea within the 30 second constraint and within the 20 days that were left before submission deadline. I begin to think that there is no idea that is too big, it just depends on how much you want it and how hard you are willing to work for it.

Although there was a set deadline and I knew what it was, I was pretty bad at managing my time. Something I should try next time now I understand workflow of making an animation better is to make a **plan**.

All in all, was a great learning experience not only for me, but my friend Dineth as well. 10/10 would struggle again.

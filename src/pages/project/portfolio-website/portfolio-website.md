# Background

Last summer after school was out I wanted to make myself a website. HTML and CSS? Easy peasy!

**_Wrong._**

There were a lot of problems with this. I can't write any logic with HTML and CSS so how am I supposed to set up things like a contact page or interactive elements? I didn't even know what an element was back then.

My cursory searches of making websites returned keywords like "Javascript", "ReactJS", "NodeJS", "Angular", "Django", and "PHP". Very **overwhelming**. A friend suggested taking a look at Javascript and NodeJS along with ReactJS.

So that's what I did.

#Process

The creation of this website spanned over 7 months and it really shouldn't have. The productivity curve that resulted from this process was truly **depressing**.

I kept adding and adding and through it all I wasn't sure if I wanted any of it. I built functionality to support blogs for this website but decided to remove it and instead move my writing to Medium. It was at this point did I realize that maybe less is more. Throughout my whole life I've been taught that more is more. More words is more but I'm starting to see that this idea may not be the case. Through the whole process I've redesigned my website at around 4 times. I probably will overhaul the theme, because light theme is for noobs and people that want to be blinded.

#Closing

Looking back, I'm not sure if I should've learned JS and ReactJS. Maybe I should've just bought a squarespace subscription and a domain and slap together something way better than what I could've ever built. It was a long process but I've come to see that there are a lot of nice and supportive people in the web development community.

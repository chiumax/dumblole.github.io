# Background

Last summer after school was out I wanted to make myself a website. HTML and CSS? Easy peasy!

***Wrong.***

There were a lot of problems with this. I can't write any logic with HTML and CSS so how am I supposed to set up things like a contact page or interactive elements? I didn't even know what an element was back then.

My cursory searches of making websites returned keywords like "Javascript", "ReactJS", "NodeJS", "Angular", "Django", and "PHP". Very **overwhelming**. A friend suggested taking a look at Javascript and NodeJS along with ReactJS. 

So that's what I did.

#Process

The creation of this website spanned over 7 months and it really shouldn't have. The productivity curve that resulted from this process was truly **depressing**.

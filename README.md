## Background :flags:

7-8 month long project. I had no idea what I was getting myself into... Should've just gotten a squarespace site.

Anyways, it's hosted on firebase.

## Code Style :art:

-   I use the [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) code formatter for js and scss (default settings from the vs-code extension except for line width set to 100).
